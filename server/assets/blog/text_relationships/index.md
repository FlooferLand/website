Okay so, starting off strong.
**A RELATIONSHIP.** **A PARTNER.**
Best thing ever right? _(for the aro people reading: its like having a really really close best friend)_

But after online dating people for about 5 years of my life-span now, its come to my attention there is a **BIG** problem. And now that I'm officially 18 years of age ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I feel like I'm finally ready to talk about these serious things.
Online relationships are fine, they can work in some cases.
Text-based relationships, will not work out, though. Sounds crazy right, would've bene an absolute shocker to 14 y/o me.

The difference is, text relationships mean no video calls, or even no calls at all. Which may sound weird, but is VERY common on platforms such as Discord _(I will roast the platform in due time)_.
The problem inherently lies not only in the sense of identity you have of your partner, but also the lack of connection.
When your partner has an anime pfp, and you don't talk via video or voice often, your _(degenerate or not)_ mind will generate a false image of them, often giving toxic partners the upper-hand since I swear to god they always look like undercooked shrimp irl.
On a serious note.. From my personal experience, you **NEED** to know what they look like, not only to avoid Twitter users with MAP in their bio, but also because there are very malicious people that you will meet in your life if you're already on this path of text dating. You will meet people who will pretend to love you in order to hurt you or

All of that is neat and nice, "its fine, we love each other way too much" you think.
Well, rest assured, you are fucked if you ever meet in real life. People almost always act different in real life, and they'll certainly look different from their anime profile pic.

To my fellow degenerates, and 4chan/reddit doom-scrollers _(you are the lower class degenerate type)_.
Please in the name of the skinwalker that is currently in your house, **REGULARLY CALL YOUR PARTNER!**. **OH AND PLEASE KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IN REAL LIFE THAT IS RIDICULOUSLY IMPORTANT**
I've had about 15 or so different relationships and I first started dating people on Discord when i was 13.
While I am currently bitchless as of typing this, I am 99.8999999% sure this will help massively.

Another thing that would help is: do not date anyone to begin with üëç
Ace/aro people are OP
