I've been working on this website for weeks now
and it's been by far one of the most time-consuming projects I've ever worked on.

I used to have another website (https://flooferland.neocities.org/) but then I wanted to start a blog
and doing an entire blog website on Neocities in a convenient way wouldn't be that fun.

So I made this! A brand new website, combining all sorts of things from all my other websites into one site.

## Design
I'm trying to go for a 2000s frutiger aero design for this website, think of stuff like Windows 7.
Currently still quite rough, not sure what to do with the background.
I'd add a comment section for feedback, but thats for future me to add xD

## The technical stuff
![explorer.png](./content/explorer.png)
This website is built using Svelte and the entire website is open-source licensed under GNU GPL 3.
There's a LOT of server-side rendering, so you can use most of the website without JS.
The server-side rendering might end up being a performance problem on my side but ehhh.. Thats a future me problem <CharEmoji id="nobitches" />

I still have a LOT to figure out, so this site will be a work in progress for a while.
Right as I'm typing this, there's no way to load images. So the actual implementation for the image you (hopefully) saw at the start of the technical stuff section was added in after I actually added in the image.
Everything is kinda broken as I'm writing this post, for example my custom emoji system doesn't work, and there is no autocompletion (I hate mdsvex).
